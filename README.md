# SpaceImmersion
 
![Alt text](pics/screenshot2.png?raw=true "Title")

A sketch made with OpenFrameworks.

This started as a program to find nice immersions of simple surfaces (made by gluing parallelogram edges) in R^3. As I was toying with different forces, I accidentially made the springs non-commutative and the whole mesh started to "run" along one of its axes. The effect was very interesting, so I committed to it. Run it to see an interesting, undulating blob that somehow never settles down into a stable configuration.
